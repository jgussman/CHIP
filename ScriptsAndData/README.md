(Assumes that you have the chip environment already activated if not ```conda activate chip```)


## Step 1
Open *main_pipeline.py* in your IDE of choice.  

Use CTRL+F to find the following line of ocde 

```
if __name__ == '__main__':
```
The only code you should ever have to change is in this if-statement, particularly the following 2-lines

```{python} 
    crossMatchedNames = pd.read_csv("../spocData/testStars.txt",sep=" ")
    chipObject.Run(use_data=False,slow_normalize = True)
```

**crossMatchedNames** will be assigned to be a N by 2 dataframe. The file read in must contain two columns, the first column is the starâ€™s identifier in any dataset you want (in our case SPOCS). The second column MUST be the identifier for the star in the NEXSCI database with the column header name ```HIRES```. CHIP will name all the data files corresponding to the first column's id. 

**chipObject.Run( ... , ... )** CHIP's Run method has 2 parameters that are extremely important (both are defaulted to False). The first parameter (use_data) if set to True will use the download spectra and normalized Spectra from your previous run. The second parameter (slow_normalize) if set to True use Alpha normalization instead of the default normalization. The alpha normalization is much slower than the default normalization from specutils but it produces more accurate results. 

## Step 2
You're now all set to run *main_pipeline.py*. 

## Step 3
Once *main_pipeline.py* is completed open *main_The_Cannon.py*. 

You should only need to can change the valariables in the following dotted area to fit your specificities:  
```{python} 
###
###Anything BELOW this point (to the stop point) can be editted to work with your needs
###

...

###
###Anything ABOVE this point (to the start point) can be editted to work with your needs
###
```

Each variable has a comment above them detailing as short as possible what it is used for. 

## Step 4
Now you can run *main_The_Cannon.py*! The defaulted settings hopefully only take your machine a hour or less to run. 

*main_The_Cannon.py* will produce a file called Results.csv. 

Results.csv contains useful information about all the models trained and at the bottom of the file is the best model. 

## Step 5
If you so wish you can plot the results of the best model using Plot_Results.py.
