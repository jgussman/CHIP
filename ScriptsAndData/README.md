# Tutorial: Getting Started with CHIP
---

Note: This tutorial assumes that you already have the CHIP environment activated. If not, run the command ```conda activate chip```.

There are two key files that the user will edit to run CHIP: *main_pipeline.py* (Step 1) and *main_The_Cannon.py* (Step 2).

## Step 1
Open *main_pipeline.py*. Find the following line of code: 

```
if __name__ == '__main__':
```
The only code you should ever have to change in this file is within this if-statement, In particular, following 2-lines

```{python} 
    crossMatchedNames = pd.read_csv("../spocData/testStars.txt",sep=" ")
    chipObject.Run(use_data=False,slow_normalize = True)
```

**crossMatchedNames** will be assigned to be a dataframe with the size (N x 2). The file that is read in must contain two columns:
1. The first column is the starâ€™s identifier (in our case, we use the star names within the SPOCS dataset). CHIP will name all of its output files to correspond with the identifiers provided in the first column. 
2. The second column MUST be the identifier for the star in the NEXSCI database with the column header name ```HIRES```. 

**chipObject.Run( ... , ... )** CHIP's Run method has 2 parameters that are extremely important, and both are defaulted to False:
1. use_data: If set to True, CHIP will use the download spectra and normalized spectra from your previous run. 
2. slow_normalize: If set to True, CHIP will use an alpha shapes continuum normalization instead of the default normalization from specutils. The alpha normalization is much slower than the specutils normalization; however, it produces more accurate results. 


## Step 2
Once the settings in *main_pipeline.py* have been confirmed, open *main_The_Cannon.py*. 

You should only need to change the variables in the following dotted area to suit your specifications:  
```{python} 
###
###Anything BELOW this point (to the stop point) can be edited to work with your needs
###

...

###
###Anything ABOVE this point (to the start point) can be edited to work with your needs
###
```

Each variable has a comment above it that briefly details what it represents.

Now you can run CHIP using *main_The_Cannon.py*! The default settings should take roughly an hour or less to run. 

*main_The_Cannon.py* will produce a file called Results.csv. This output file contains diagnostic information about all trained models, and the best model is provided at the bottom of the file.

## Step 3 (optional)
To visualize the results from the best model, you can run Plot_Results.py.
